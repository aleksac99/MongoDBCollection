# PyMongo Problem Collection

This repository contains a collection of various problems regarding MongoDB Database querying. Queries are written in Python, using Pymongo driver for MongoDB.


This repo represents a simple collection of queries I find worth revising. For now, it will be updated only by adding new problems in the same fashion as now. Potential idea for future work is to create a LeetCode-like application for MongoDB queries.
