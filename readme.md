# PyMongo Problem Collection

This repository contains a collection of various problems regarding MongoDB Database querying. Queries are written in Python, using Pymongo driver for MongoDB. The data is also available in this repo under the name `data.json`.


This repo represents a simple collection of queries I find worth revising. For now, it will be updated only by adding new problems in the same fashion as now. Potential idea for future work is to create a LeetCode-like application for MongoDB queries.

## Problem Count

## Contribution

For now, only contribution I suggest is creating new questions. You can put them in `questions.md` file, which contains the list of unsolved questions.
